      # @ Felipe
      #
      # Now also passes the host to the git_init method
      # Notice how I replaced the "git remote add webbynode git@#{ip}:{app_name}"
      # to "git remote add webbynode git@#{ip}:{HOST}"
      #
      # Is this a good idea? The reason I did this is because when you execute
      # webbynode remote 'ls -la' to read out the directory, it parses the .pushand file to
      # fetch the [host]. However, what apparently happens is that the folder on the remote server
      # would always be named after the folder on the local machine (app_name) in this case.
      # So I changed this app_name to host inside the git_init method so that if you for example execute:
      #
      # webbynode init 2.2.2.2 dev.webbynode.com
      #
      # It will create for example: /var/rails/dev.webbynode.com, which, also is in my opinion better than just webbynode
      # because if you want to have subdomains (such as that dev. (development) subdomain, it's more clear as to what is the main and what is the subdomain)
      #
      # One problem (which should be easy to solve but I think it's serverside) is that it apparently attempts to create a user for the MySQL and PostgreSQL database.
      # And as we both know it will most likely fail when it creates a user with the username: dev.webbynode.com instead. I deployed an app, and this seemed to be the case.
      # It failed to create a database and migrate it because it couldn't find the user, which most likely cannot be created due to the name I think. So I changed it to root
      # manually inside the config/database.yml and it worked again.
      #
      # What do you think?
      #
      # Here is an example of what got rendered as database.yml on my Webby
      #
      # # inside: /var/rails/test.wizardry-ls.com/config/database.yml
      # production:
      #   adapter: mysql
      #   encoding: utf8
      #   database: test.wizardry-ls.com # <= Will fail
      #   username: test.wizardry-ls.com # <= Will fail
      #   password: mypassword
      #
      # I think we should always strip out "any" characters for the database.yml that aren't characters/digits. So that you end up always having alphanumeric.
      # The only issue is the database.yml on this part as far as I can see. If we can fix it so it will remove any non [a-zA-z0-9] characters then it should work
      # right out of the box.
